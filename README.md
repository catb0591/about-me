#About Me
My name is Catherine Becerra. I go by Cat for short. I work at a local credit union as the Strategy and Support Leader of the mortgage department. I oversee the secondary markets team along with the system administrators. I have enjoyed working with the system admins and getting more exposure to the tech side of the business.
